# CarParkingSystem
(Prototype Not Update yet)

Project Car Parking System is designed to automatically detect available empty parking slots.
When a slot is empty, new vehicles are allowed to enter the parking. However, if the slot is full, the entrance is blocked using a servo controlled by an Arduino UNO and WeMosD1R1. 
Vehicle movement is detected by IR sensors, and the parking status is displayed on an LCD screen.
The ability to connect to Wi-Fi allows for further development, such as the creation of a mobile app or a cloud database.
